# Paxi Whitepaper

## Introduction
Paxi is a next-generation blockchain protocol designed with simplicity, speed, and radical decentralization at its core. Built on the Cosmos SDK and CometBFT consensus engine — with deep optimizations tailored for enhanced performance and security — and implemented in the Go programming language, Paxi aims to provide a highly efficient, low-fee, and user-friendly blockchain infrastructure that is open to all.

Paxi also supports CosmWasm, a smart contract platform based on Wasm, enabling developers to build secure and efficient contracts in Rust — perfect for DeFi, DAOs, and cross-chain dApps.

Paxi believes in the philosophy of "less is more" — every feature exists to serve purpose and efficiency. By focusing on essential functionality and avoiding unnecessary complexity, Paxi ensures a seamless experience for developers, validators, and end users alike.

## Vision
To create a fast, secure, and truly decentralized blockchain ecosystem that empowers everyone — not just token whales — to participate in consensus, development, and innovation.

---

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity**: Minimal design, clean APIs, and non-bloated protocol logic
- **Speed**: Optimized performance and high throughput, capable of handling thousands of transactions per second
- **Decentralization**: Open validator set, low participation threshold, governance by the many, not the few
- **Security**: Built on robust Byzantine Fault Tolerance and a lean, auditable codebase
- **Accessibility**: Designed for developers of all levels, including no-code and low-code contract authors

---

## Technology Stack

- **Cosmos SDK**: Modular framework for blockchain application development
- **CometBFT**: BFT consensus engine providing fast finality and secure networking
- **CosmWasm**: Smart contract platform based on WebAssembly (Wasm), allowing developers to build secure and efficient contracts in Rust 
- **Go Language**: Known for its speed, simplicity, and concurrency support — ideal for high-performance blockchain infrastructure

---

## Developer Experience

Paxi is committed to lowering the barrier to entry for blockchain application development. To achieve this, it will include:

- An integrated development environment (IDE) tailored for Paxi smart contracts
- Intuitive SDKs and APIs
- No-code/low-code smart contract options
- Rich documentation and tutorials

Even non-programmers will be able to deploy decentralized applications (dApps) on Paxi.

---

## Validator Participation

Paxi democratizes consensus by reducing the technical and economic requirements needed to run a validator node. This ensures that the network remains open and inclusive, minimizing the concentration of power and enhancing decentralization.

- No large stake requirement to join as a validator
- Encourages geographically and demographically distributed participation
- Built-in incentives for stability and uptime

---

## Inflation Model

Paxi starts with an initial token supply of **100 million tokens** and follows an **annual inflation model** to incentivize staking and secure the network.

- **Year 1**: Inflation capped at **10%** of total supply
- **Year 2**: Inflation capped at **5%**
- **Year 3 onward**: Inflation capped at **2.5%** annually
- All block rewards go to stakers (validators and delegators)
- The system includes an **automatic burn mechanism** to reduce excess tokens based on supply-demand dynamics

This model ensures long-term sustainability while aligning incentives for active participation and economic security.

## Use Cases

Paxi is designed to support a wide range of real-world applications:

- **DeFi**: Low-fee, high-speed infrastructure for decentralized finance
- **GameFi**: Scalable engine for blockchain gaming and NFT integration
- **Social & Identity**: Trustless systems for social apps, identity, and credentialing
- **Enterprise & IoT**: Minimalist design makes it suitable for enterprise-grade and embedded devices

---

## Community & Governance

Paxi will be governed through an open, on-chain proposal and voting system. Key principles include:

- Transparent governance process
- Community-driven funding and development
- Decentralized upgrades and protocol changes

---

## Conclusion

Paxi is not just another blockchain. It is a principled approach to solving the complexities and inefficiencies found in modern Layer 1 networks. By staying true to simplicity, performance, and decentralization, Paxi aims to redefine what a truly user-first blockchain can be.

We invite developers, validators, creators, and dreamers to join the Paxi movement.

**Build less. Achieve more. Build on Paxi.**
