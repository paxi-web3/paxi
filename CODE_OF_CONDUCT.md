# Code of Conduct (Contributor Covenant)

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people  
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
- Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by mistakes  
- Focusing on what benefits the entire community, not just the individual

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Sexual language or imagery, or sexual attention or advances of any kind  
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing private information (e.g., address, email) without consent  
- Other behavior inappropriate for professional/community environments

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards
and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior
they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. They may remove,
edit, or reject comments, commits, code, or contributions that do not follow
this Code of Conduct, and will explain moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spacesâ€”e.g.,
using an official email, social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at events.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders via the Paxi Discord: **https://discord.com/invite/rA9Xzs69tx**.  
All reports will be reviewed and addressed promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are expected to maintain the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
