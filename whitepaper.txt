Paxi Whitepaper
Overview
Paxi is a blockchain protocol based on the Proof of Stake (POS) consensus mechanism, aiming to deliver a simple, fast, low-fee, and secure blockchain network. Designed to accommodate a variety of applications, Paxi supports quick payments, financial services, GameFi, DeFi, among other functions that can be implemented via Paxi's smart contracts.

Technical Foundation
The Paxi protocol is developed using the Go programming language, known for its speed of development, operational efficiency, and clean syntax. These attributes make Paxi's core code highly attractive, drawing more technical experts to join and contribute to the development and maintenance effort within the open-source community.

Core Philosophy
The core philosophy of Paxi is "less is more", ensuring the system is fully functional without redundancy, thereby offering an ultra-simplified and high-speed blockchain network. This approach not only optimizes the system performance but also greatly enhances the user and developer experience.

Usability and Scalability
To reduce the entry barrier for developers, Paxi will provide an easy-to-use Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This tool allows even those with little to no coding experience to develop smart contracts on the Paxi blockchain, significantly lowering the hurdle for blockchain technology and application development.

Decentralization
In terms of decentralization, Paxi sets a low threshold for becoming a validator, ensuring participation is accessible to everyone and not just those with large token holdings. This prevents validation rights from becoming centralized among a few, promoting more extensive decentralization.

Token Distribution and Economic Model
The initial issuance of Paxi tokens is 100 million, following an annual inflation model. The inflation rate for the first year will not exceed 10% of the total issuance, 5% for the second year, and a maximum of 2% each year thereafter. For instance, in the first year, approximately 10 million additional tokens are expected to be generated. If a total of 10 million tokens are staked, the annual staking return would be around 100%. Similarly, if the total staked amount is 20 million, the annual staking return would be approximately 50%. The system will automatically burn any excess tokens based on supply and demand.

Token Distribution:
15% to the founding team and advisors (unlocked over three phases)
20% to the Paxi Foundation for development, maintenance, and promotion
20% for private sales and venture capital
30% for public sale
15% for bounty programs, such as app downloads and user referrals
This white paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Paxi blockchain network, inspiring confidence and interest in our project among potential stakeholders and partners.
